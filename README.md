Data Source 
World Happiness Report (2008 – 2023) is an open-source publication produced yearly in partnership of Gallup, the Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, and WHR’s Editorial Board. Life evaluations from the Gallup World Poll provide the basis for the annual happiness rankings. They are based on answers to the main life evaluation question. Although it is produced by reputable bodies, it is subject to some limitations: subjectivity of self-reported data, cultural biases, survey sample representativeness, limited dimensions of well-being.

Developed by Dutch social psychologist Geert Hofstede, the theory identifies six dimensions along which cultures can be compared.
